# This file serves as a template. A developer can copy it to a .env file and fill in their local credentials if they are not using the default public MindsDB database for testing.
# File: .env.example

# These are credentials for a local test database.
# If these are not provided in a .env file, the tests will default to using the MindsDB public sample database.
TEST_DB_USER=test_user
TEST_DB_PASSWORD=test_password
TEST_DB_HOST=localhost
TEST_DB_PORT=5432
